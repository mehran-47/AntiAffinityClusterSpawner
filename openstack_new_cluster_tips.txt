1. Before creating/spawning a new VM, make sure the 'instances' volume is unmounted from all the hypervisors. (e.g. SSH to each node and execute "umount 192.168.205.42:/var/lib/nova/instances")
2. For spawning a new VM, execute the following from the controller node (hostname: node-10, IP:192.168.205.42)	
	"nova boot --flavor 2 --image e2d1303b-0b1f-41ce-a15e-5545a0437d6f new_elasticity_HTTP_3"
where --flavor 2 refers to a micro instance, e2d1...7d6f is the uuid of the image stored at /var/lib/nova/instances of the head node and new_elasticity_HTTP_3 is the VM name.
3. Once the VM is created, move the storage of the newly created VM to the networked filesystem in the controller node. For example, if the VM is created in node-6, with ID 0b18...823 , there should be a new directory created in /var/lib/nova/instances/0b18...823 . Move/copy this directory to 192.168.205.42:/var/lib/nova/instances.
4. If the controller node (node10) is rebooted, make sure the IPTable DROP rule is not disabled, network mounting will not work. 
	a. iptables -L --line-numbers (to list all the rules fetched from FUEL)
	b. iptables -D INPUT 35 (block all connections to all ports except FTP and SSH)
5. In the 'bridge' VM (uuid: 8769b3af-5f81-4c65-b7d4-9aef8daf0fb6, name: ubuntu-demo-client), start_teamviewer execution does not necessarily start teamviewer. You will need to execute all of its commands manually to start teamviewer.
6. Add startup by using the command (did to fix http-component not starting by default)
	6.1: First, put the script (start_osaf in this example) in '/etc/init.d', then issue the following command
	6.2: Use 'sudo' to start opensaf rather than simply putting 'service opensaf start'. Put the following statement in 'start_osaf' and make 'start_osaf' executable.
		e.g.: echo magic123 | sudo -S service opensafd start
	6.3 Update startup defaults by issuing the following command:
		update-rc.d start_osaf defaults
